# Health Insurance Candidate Application Decision Process

This repository contains two source code files in the `src` folder, each exploring different aspects of a health insurance decision-making process using machine learning techniques. The scripts focus on the prediction of application outcomes and decision-making processes, providing a practical demonstration of machine learning models in healthcare.

## Source Code

### 1. Case Study: Health Insurance Candidate Application Decision Process
This script delves into the decision-making process for health insurance candidate applications. It explores data-driven approaches to assess whether a candidate is eligible for insurance coverage, utilizing machine learning models to improve the decision-making process.

#### Contents
- **Data Preprocessing:** Steps to clean and prepare the data for analysis.
- **Feature Engineering:** Methods used to create meaningful features from the raw data.
- **Model Training and Evaluation:** Implementation of different machine learning models and their evaluation on the given dataset.
- **Insights and Analysis:** Key takeaways from the model performance and its implications for health insurance decision-making.

### 2. Case Study: Health Insurance Candidate Application Decision Process (Second Script)
This script builds upon the previous analysis by exploring additional aspects of the decision-making process, with a specific focus on improving model performance and drawing conclusions about the practical implications of the results.

#### Contents
- **Advanced Feature Engineering:** Further techniques to enhance model performance.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Fine-tuning of machine learning models to achieve better results.
- **Model Interpretability:** Techniques used to interpret the results and apply them to real-world decision-making processes.
- **Practical Implications:** Discussion of how these models can influence decision-making in a health insurance context.
